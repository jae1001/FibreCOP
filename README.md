# FibreCOP
The main program FibreCOP calculates the Chebyshev/Herman orientation parameters
for aligned fibres from their SEM image/intensity distribution data.
Digital photographs of macroscopic fibres can also be analysed.

Preferred formats:
Image: '.tiff', imread in openCV also supports most other filetypes such as
        .jpg, .png etc. 
Data: '.csv' format with no headers and only X and Y columns.

Please download the icon.gif along with the code, for smooth execution of the program
or comment out the appropriate lines in the code.

Analysis data is stored in FibreCOP_result.csv

Code developed by Dr. A. Kaniyoor, Macromolecular Materials Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK
Correspondednce can also be directed to Prof. J. A. Elliott, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK
